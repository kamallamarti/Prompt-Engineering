# PROMPT Engineering: How to Guide an LLM to Optimal Output using Python

This project draws inspiration from [Andrew Ng and Isa Fulford's excellent course](https://www.example.com), "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers." The repository showcases the art of prompt engineering for [OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering?ref=learninglab.dk), providing insights into effective communication with the language model for specific tasks using simple and clear prompts. 

## Prerequisite:
- [OpenAI API](https://www.openai.com/api/)
- [VSCode or Jupyter notebook](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Here's a breakdown of the featured functionalities:

1. **Summarization:** Craft precise prompts for clear and relevant summaries.
2. **Creative Book Titles:** Generate imaginative book titles, authors, and genres in JSON format.
3. **Instruction Sequencing:** Transform descriptive text into step-by-step instructions.
4. **Product Description Generation:** Create compelling product descriptions from technical fact sheets with optional HTML formatting.
5. **Product Review Summary:** Extract shipping-related information from a product review.
6. **Multilingual Translation:** Translate phrases to French, Spanish, and English pirate style.
7. **Formal and Informal Translation:** Translate a sentence to French in both formal and informal styles.
8. **Slang to Business Letter Translation:** Transform casual language into a formal business letter.
