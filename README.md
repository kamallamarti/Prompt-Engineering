# PROMPT Engineering: How to Guide an LLM to Optimal Output

This project draws inspiration from Andrew Ng and Isa Fulford's excellent course, "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers." The repository showcases the art of prompt engineering for OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, providing insights into effective communication with the language model for specific tasks using simple and clear prompts. Here's a breakdown of the featured functionalities:

1. **Summarization:** Craft precise prompts for clear and relevant summaries.
2. **Creative Book Titles:** Generate imaginative book titles, authors, and genres in JSON format.
3. **Instruction Sequencing:** Transform descriptive text into step-by-step instructions.
4. **Product Description Generation:** Create compelling product descriptions from technical fact sheets with optional HTML formatting.
5. **Product Review Summary:** Extract shipping-related information from a product review.
6. **Multilingual Translation:** Translate phrases to French, Spanish, and English pirate style.
7. **Formal and Informal Translation:** Translate a sentence to French in both formal and informal styles.
8. **Slang to Business Letter Translation:** Transform casual language into a formal business letter.
